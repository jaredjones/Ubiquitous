# Ubiquitous Computing

## Introduction

A repository for our UH Fall 2015 Ubiquitous Course.

Throughout the entire semester group homework assignments, projects, in-class assignments, etc will be uploaded to this repository. We will also insure the proper usage of branches for strict feature changes. Any new feature that is added that does not interfere with an existing code base MUST be rebased instead of merged.

All of the code submitted to this repository will undergo unit testing, if you fuck something up, everybody will receive an email.

## Requirements

+ Platform: Apple OS X Yosemite or El Capitan
+ Apple HW: Intel Processor w/ Metal Support
+ Xcode 6 or 7
+ [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)
